- **Purpose**: Enable performance analysis at lesson level for students
- **Data Storage**: lesson_id is stored with each question to enable future analytics
- **Future Reports**:
  - Lesson-wise accuracy of students (e.g., 'Students scored 75% on Lesson: Algebra Basics')
  - Lesson-wise difficulty analysis (e.g., 'Lesson: Photosynthesis has 60% Hard questions')
  - Lesson-wise question distribution (e.g., 'Lesson: Shakespeare Introduction has 10Multiple Choice, 5 Short Answer, 3 Match the Following, 2 Multiple Response MCQ questions')
  - Student performance comparison across lessons
  - Class-wise lesson performance trends
  - **Negative marking impact analysis**: Track how negative marking affects student scores

#### 6.5.2 Analytics Dashboard Components
- Lesson performance heatmap
- Student accuracy by lesson chart
- Question difficulty distribution by lesson
- Lesson completion rates
- Comparative analysis across classes and subjects
- **Negative marking statistics**: Average minus marks applied, questions with highest negative marking impact

### 6.6 Database Migration Script

#### 6.6.1 Migration Steps
1. **Create Lessons Table** (if not existing):
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS lessons (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  subject_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES subjects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  lesson_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  lesson_code VARCHAR(50),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```\n
2. **Alter Question Bank Table**:
```sql
ALTER TABLE question_bank\nADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS bank_name VARCHAR(100),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS lesson_id UUID REFERENCES lessons(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS question_images JSONB,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS minus_mark DECIMAL(5,2) DEFAULT 0;\n```

3. **Update question_type Enum** (if using PostgreSQL enum type):
```sql
ALTER TYPE question_type_enum ADD VALUE IF NOT EXISTS 'Match the Following';
ALTER TYPE question_type_enum ADD VALUE IF NOT EXISTS 'Multiple Response MCQ';
```

4. **Create Index for Performance**:
```sql
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_lessons_subject_id ON lessons(subject_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_question_bank_lesson_id ON question_bank(lesson_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_question_bank_bank_name ON question_bank(bank_name);\nCREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_question_bank_images ON question_bank USING GIN (question_images);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_question_bank_minus_mark ON question_bank(minus_mark);
```\n
5. **Add Foreign Key Constraint**:
```sql
ALTER TABLE question_bank\nADD CONSTRAINT fk_question_bank_lesson\nFOREIGN KEY (lesson_id) REFERENCES lessons(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
```

6. **Backfill bank_name for Existing Records** (if applicable):
```sql
UPDATE question_bank
SET bank_name = CONCAT(classes.class_name, '_', subjects.subject_name)\nFROM classes, subjects
WHERE question_bank.class_id = classes.id\nAND question_bank.subject_id = subjects.id\nAND question_bank.bank_name IS NULL;
```\n
7. **Set Default Minus Mark for Existing Records**:
```sql
UPDATE question_bank
SET minus_mark = 0\nWHERE minus_mark IS NULL;
```\n
#### 6.6.2 Migration Validation
- Verify lessons table creation
- Verify foreign key constraints are intact
- Verify indexes are created
- Test cascading delete behavior
- Validate bank_name auto-generation logic
- Verify new question types (Match the Following, Multiple Response MCQ) are added to question_type enum
- **Verify question_images column is created with JSONB type**
- **Verify minus_mark column is created with DECIMAL(5,2) type and default value 0**
- **Test minus_mark validation and storage**
